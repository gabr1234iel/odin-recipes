        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Lasagna is a type of pasta dish that consists of layers of flat, 
            wide noodles, meat or vegetables, and a sauce, typically made with 
            tomatoes or a creamy bechamel. The noodles are often cooked al dente, 
            or slightly firm, before being layered with the other ingredients and 
            baked in the oven. The dish is then typically served hot and cut into 
            squares or rectangles for individual servings.

            There are many variations of lasagna, but a classic Italian version 
            typically includes layers of pasta, ground beef or pork, and a tomato-based 
            sauce. Other common ingredients include mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese, 
            and fresh basil. Vegetarian versions of lasagna may include layers of roasted 
            vegetables, such as zucchini, eggplant, and bell peppers, in place of the 
            meat. Some versions may also include a layer of béchamel sauce, a creamy 
            white sauce made with milk and flour, for added richness.

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook the pasta:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and cook until al dente, according to the package instructions. Drain the noodles and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown the meat:</strong> In a large skillet, heat a small amount of oil over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef or pork and cook, stirring occasionally, until it is browned and crumbled. Drain any excess fat and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> In a separate pot, heat a small amount of oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant. Add a can of crushed tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Season the sauce with salt, pepper, and dried herbs such as oregano and basil.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong> Preheat the oven to <em>350°F (180°C)</em>. Spread a small amount of sauce in the bottom of a large baking dish. Top with a layer of cooked lasagna noodles, followed by a layer of the meat sauce and a layer of cheese. Repeat the layers until all of the ingredients are used up, ending with a layer of cheese on top.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the lasagna:</strong> Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
